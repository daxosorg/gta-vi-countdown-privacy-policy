Privacy Policy for GTA VI Countdown – Fan App
Effective Date: [Insert Date Here] Last Updated: [Insert Date Here]
Daxos Software (India) (“we”, “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy
Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use the GTA VI Countdown – Fan
App (the “App”). By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy. If you have
questions, please contact us at daxos.software@gmail.com.
Information We Collect
1
We follow GDPR’s data minimization principle, meaning we collect and process only data absolutely
necessary for app functionality. In practice, our App collects no personal information about you. We
do not require or obtain names, email addresses, phone numbers, contacts, or any other direct
identifiers. No user accounts, registration, or login is required. We do not gather your location, camera,
microphone, or files. We also do not use any analytics or other third-party SDKs that collect your usage
data. The only data ever used by the App is non-sensitive technical information for advertising (see
Advertising and AdMob below). Crucially, we do not store any user information on any servers we
control.
•
•
•
•
•
No Personal Data: We do not collect your name, contact information, or other personal details.
No Accounts or Registration: There is no sign-up or account creation; you can use the App
anonymously.
No In-App Purchases or Payment Data: The App is free and contains no purchases, so we
never process payment or transaction data.
No Analytics: We do not integrate Google Analytics or any other tracking analytics; we do not
track how you use the App.
Only Required Data: The App only uses data that are strictly necessary (for example, simple
1
server calls to fetch news or content); as per GDPR principles, we minimize all data collection .
Third-Party Services and Advertising
2
Our App is ad-supported and uses Google AdMob to display banner ads, interstitial ads, and native
ads. Google AdMob collects certain device and usage information (such as your device’s advertising ID,
IP address, and basic app usage data) to serve and target ads. We do not use any other advertising
networks or third-party ad providers. We have no affiliate or ad revenue partnerships beyond Google
AdMob. Aside from advertising, no other third-party services or SDKs are integrated into the App.
•
•
•
Google AdMob: We use AdMob for all ads. AdMob may collect non-personal device identifiers
(e.g. Advertising ID) and coarse location (from IP address) to optimize ad delivery.
Ad Formats: The App shows banner ads (small ads at top/bottom), interstitial ads (full-screen
between screens), and native ads (customized ad placements) via AdMob.
No Other Third Parties: We do not include any social media plugins, analytics tools, or
additional SDKs.
2
By using AdMob, we follow Google’s policy requiring disclosure of data use .
1
Personalized Ads and User Consent
3
Google’s policies and EU law require that we obtain user consent before using personal data for
personalized advertising in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK. Our App implements
Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) to request consent from EEA/UK users. When you first run
the App in the EEA/UK, you will see a consent dialog explaining how Google and we use your data for
ads. You can choose to allow or deny personalized ads. If you consent, AdMob will serve ads based on
your device’s Advertising ID and other non-sensitive data. If you do not consent (or if you are outside
EEA/UK), you will only see non-personalized ads (generic ads not based on your profile).
Google requires a certified Consent Management Platform for personalized ads in the EU/UK comply by using UMP to manage and record your choices. In summary:
4
. We
•
•
Personalized Ads (with consent): Ads may be tailored to your interests using your Advertising
ID and anonymized profile data.
Non-Personalized Ads (without consent): Ads will still appear but will not use your personal
data for targeting.
• 3 4
Consent Management: We ask for and honor your consent choices in the EEA/UK . You
can withdraw consent at any time by reinstalling the app or through Android’s ads settings.
Data Usage
We (Daxos Software) do not use your data for any purposes beyond serving ads. Specifically, we do not
sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties. The only purpose of the data collected
via AdMob is ad targeting as described above. We do not perform any profiling beyond what AdMob
does automatically (and you can opt out of that by revoking consent). We do not email you marketing
messages, nor do we link any device data to your identity.
GDPR (EU/EEA/UK) Compliance
5
If you are located in the EU, EEA, or UK, the GDPR applies to your data. We abide by GDPR principles :
lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, and security. We
6
have identified consent as our lawful basis for processing data used in personalized advertising .
Where we do process any personal data (e.g. Advertising ID), we do so only with your explicit consent
(for personalized ads) or our legitimate interest (for basic app operation).
7
You have the following rights under GDPR :
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Right to Be Informed: You have the right to know how your data is processed. This Privacy
Policy provides that information.
Right of Access: You can request a copy of any personal data we hold about you (though we
hold virtually none).
Right to Rectification: You can request correction of any inaccurate personal data.
Right to Erasure (“Right to be Forgotten”): You can ask us to delete your personal data. (Since
we hold no personal user profiles, this generally does not apply.)
Right to Restrict Processing: You can ask us to limit how we use your data.
Right to Data Portability: You can request your data in a portable format.
Right to Object: You can object to our processing of your data (e.g., withdrawing consent to
ads).
2
•
Right to Withdraw Consent: If you previously consented to personalized ads, you may
withdraw consent at any time via the app’s consent flow or your device settings.
To exercise any GDPR rights, contact us at daxos.software@gmail.com. We will respond in accordance
with the law (generally within one month). Note that because we do not hold personal data linked to
your identity, many of these rights are limited in practice. You may also lodge a complaint with a
European data protection authority if you believe your rights have been violated.
We transfer data to Google’s servers (which may be outside the EEA/UK, e.g. in the USA). Google
adheres to GDPR requirements and provides appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual
Clauses) to permit these international transfers.
CCPA/CPRA (California) Compliance
If you are a California resident, the CCPA/CPRA grants you specific rights regarding your personal
information. We have indicated that we collect no categories of personal information beyond limited ad-
8
related identifiers. Nevertheless, under California law, you have rights including :
•
•
•
•
•
•
Right to Know: You can request disclosure of what categories of personal information we collect
and why. (We collect only device IDs for ads.)
Right to Delete: You can request deletion of any personal information we have (subject to
certain exceptions).
Right to Opt-Out of Sale/Sharing: You can opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal
information. We do not sell your personal data. However, the use of your data by Google for
targeted ads could be considered a “sale” under CCPA. You may opt out of interest-based
advertising by visiting Google’s Ads Settings or using your device settings (AdMob respects the
“Limit Ad Tracking” setting).
Right to Correct: You can ask us to correct any inaccurate personal information.
Right to Limit Use of Sensitive Data (CPRA): You can direct us to limit use of any sensitive
personal data (we do not collect sensitive data beyond ad identifiers).
Right to Non-Discrimination: You will not be discriminated against for exercising your CCPA/
CPRA rights.
To make a CCPA/CPRA request, please contact us at daxos.software@gmail.com. We will verify your
request as required by law (for example, via the device ID or other identifying info we may hold) and
respond within the required timeframe. In general, since we hold no conventional personal data, we
have little information to delete or correct, but we will comply with valid requests.
Google Play Data Safety
9
In compliance with Google Play’s Data Safety requirements, we have accurately declared our data
practices. The App’s Data Safety section (viewable on Google Play) indicates that we do not collect any
“Sensitive Personal Data.” The only data associated with app use is non-sensitive device/usage data
used by Google for ads. We have disclosed that this non-sensitive data (e.g. device and advertising
identifiers) is collected and shared only with Google to facilitate advertising. No other data is collected
or transmitted off-device. All data transmitted between your device and Google is encrypted in transit
using standard industry protocols.
3
Children’s Privacy (COPPA)
10
Our App is intended for a general audience (13 years and older) and is not directed at children
under 13. In accordance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not
knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently
received personal information from a child under 13, we will delete it. Parents or guardians may contact
us at daxos.software@gmail.com to request deletion of any such information.
Data Security
We implement reasonable security measures to protect any information we process 11
. All data
exchanged with Google’s servers uses secure (HTTPS/TLS) connections. Since we do not store personal
data on our servers, the risk of data breach is very low. However, please note that no method of
electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security, but we strive
to protect your information in compliance with best practices.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will update the “Last
Updated” date above. Significant changes (if any) will be communicated via email or in-app notification.
Your continued use of the App after changes are published constitutes your acceptance of the new
terms.
Contact Us
For any privacy-related questions or to exercise your rights, please contact us at
daxos.software@gmail.com. Daxos Software (India) will address your concerns in accordance with
applicable laws.
Sources: We have incorporated guidance from privacy regulations and Google policies to draft this
policy (see e.g. Google’s GDPR consent requirements 3 4 7
, GDPR data subject rights , and CCPA/
CPRA rights 8
). The App’s data handling is fully disclosed here and in its Google Play Data Safety
section 9
. All statements above reflect our actual practices.
